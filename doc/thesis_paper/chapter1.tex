\chapter{Introduction}
This chapter will be a general introduction to the topics covered in this thesis.

The paper is broken down into the following sections:  Section \ref{chap:network_vis} discusses work done on the visualization of mobile adhoc network simulation data.  Section \ref{chap:graph_simp} covers a simplification algorithm for visualizing the structure of complex graphs.  Section \ref{chap:cognet_gpu} covers work done on implementing cognitive network spectrum sensing algorithms on a programmable GPU.  The final section, Section \ref{chap:conclusion} provides a final summary of the work presented in this paper.
