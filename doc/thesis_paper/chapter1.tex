\chapter{Introduction}
This is going to be the introduction section of my thesis.  here i will expound on what it is exactly that i am looking to tell these people.  we'll see if i can get enough text in here to fill up a page maybe even a page and a half.  hopefully i can write enough text on all of my subjects to produce a decent thesis that will allow me to graduate on time.  i'm rather nervous about this whole process but we shall see how it goes.

The paper is broken down into the following sections:  Section \ref{chap:network_vis} discusses work done on the visualization of mobile adhoc network simulation data.  Section \ref{chap:graph_simp} covers a simplification algorithm for visualizing the structure of complex graphs.  Section \ref{chap:cognet_gpu} covers work done on implementing cognitive network spectrum sensing algorithms on a programmable GPU.  The final section, Section \ref{chap:conclusion} provides a final summary of the work presented in this paper.
