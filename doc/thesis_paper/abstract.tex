Visualization and simulation are important aspects of most advanced engineering endeavors.  They may provide important insights into the functionality and performance of a system during the design and evaluation stage of the system's development.  This thesis presents a number of algorithms and simulation algorithms that may be used for the design and evaluation of two types of engineered systems, mobile ad hoc and cognitive networks.  The first set of algorithms provides signal radiation pattern and digital terrain visualization capabilities to OMAN, a mobile ad hoc network simulator developed at Drexel University. The second set of algorithms provides a more general visualization capability for displaying complex graphs.  These algorithms focus on simplifying a complex graph in order to expose and highlight its underlying basic structure. The thesis closes with a description of a GPU-based implementation of a set of spectrum-sensing algorithms. Spectrum sensing is an important functionality
needed for cognitive networks.  The computational speed-ups provided by the GPU implementation offer the possibility of real-time spectrum-sensing for adaptive, cognitive networks.
