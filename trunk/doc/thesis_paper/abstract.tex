\begin{abstract}
This will be where i write my abstract for this paper.  I'm not sure exactly how i want to summarize it but I guess I will have to find a way to do it.  Hopefully it will come a little easier once i have spent a little more time writing stuff out but we shall have to wait and see.  If anything i'm sure i can get a little bit of help from dr. breen on how best to write this up, but again we shall wait and see how it all turns out in the end.  moose.
